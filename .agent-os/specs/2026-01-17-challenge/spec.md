## Activator Scoring

Each activator scores **one point** for each **unique fell** activated during 2026 for 
**each qualifying band/mode combination** on which at least one valid contact is made.

## Chaser Scoring

An equivalent scheme applies to chasers.

For chasers, **one point** is awarded for making **one or more contacts** with an activator 
using a qualifying band/mode combination.

* There is **no restriction on unique fells** for chasers.
* Scoring is limited to **one point per activator, per fell, per day, per band/mode combination**.
* Multiple QSOs with the same activator on the same fell, on the same day, using the same band/mode 
* combination count for **one point only**.
