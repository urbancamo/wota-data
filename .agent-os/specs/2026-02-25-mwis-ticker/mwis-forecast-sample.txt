Summary for all mountain areas

Mild for the time of year; freezing levels above all summits, snow still lying on high Munros but continuing to thaw to the summits. Windy, strongest near Irish Sea and south Scotland with buffeting gusts. Rain and extensive hill cloud in west Scotland, passing east and into England and Wales with time.

Headline for Lake District

Increasingly wet and foggy; blustery

How windy? (On the summits)

Southwesterly 30-40mph, notable gusts including to lower slopes. A tendency towards sustained speeds near the higher end of the range with time.

Effect of the wind on you?

Strenuous-to-arduous walking with considerable wind chill in exposure. Buffeting gusts often challenge stability, including to some middle slopes.

How Wet?

Increasingly rainy

From dawn, patchy drizzle affects the high fells, mostly south and west Lakeland. With time, patchy rain arrives and becomes more frequent with patches extending more broadly.

Cloud on the hills?

Fairly extensive

Fog shrouds the fells from middle slopes upward, often to the lower slopes of the Scafell group and towards Coniston. Best chance of higher breaks near Catbells/Blencathra, but unlikely to summits, and more extensively shrouded here with time as well.

Chance of cloud free summits?

20%

Sunshine and air clarity?

A few brighter periods towards north/east Lakeland in the morning, otherwise overcast and dull. Good visibility where out of cloud, but otherwise poor.

How Cold? (at 750m)

6C, very little change with added height, if any. Lowering slightly overnight. Feeling like -4 to -6C in strongest direct wind.

Freezing Level

Above the summits. Some patchy, thawing snow may remain on highest summits.

How windy? (On the summits)

Southwesterly 40-45mph. Strengthening for several hours at least, speeds around 45-55mph.

Effect of the wind on you?

Strenuous-to-arduous walking all day, most powerful wind requiring bracing/crouching for stability; significant wind chill.

How Wet?

Showery rain, may set in with time

Bands of rain will sweep west-to-east through the day. Dry periods between the pulses, though west and southern fells will continue to receive showery rain in the wind, perhaps more widely later.

Cloud on the hills?

Variable, lowest south and west, deteriorating

Variable, extensive over high terrain during pulses of rain, bases reaching as low as 400m on western aspects. Higher bases during dry periods, breaks to some summits in the east possible but the chance reducing.

Chance of cloud free summits?

20%

Sunshine and air clarity?

Variable cloud, sometimes brighter skies with sunny breaks east, but then overcast during rain. Good visibility during rain/fog breaks.

How Cold? (at 750m)

4 or 5C. Feeling like -10 to -12C in direct wind.

Freezing Level

Above the summits.

Last updated Tue 24th Feb 26 at 4:54PM

How windy? (On the summits)

Highly uncertain: variable speed and direction possible, though a trend towards strengthening westerlies, to 35mph+.

Effect of the wind on you?

Uncertain, variable conditions: effects may be small for several hours but a deteriorating trend likely.

How Wet?

Showery rain

A chance of showery rain across all fells, though dry intervals too. Risk of a broader area of rain moving through, but confidence is low.

Cloud on the hills?

Mostly high terrain

Fairly extensive above 500-600m in the morning, ragged lower patches too from rain. A lifting trend, some breaks possible too, but with a risk of returning extensively again if rain returns.

Chance of cloud free summits?

50%

Sunshine and air clarity?

Sun bursts possible later in the day. Very good visibility.

How Cold? (at 750m)

Range of 2 to 4C, uncertainty in timing of changes, but a general cooling trend. Feeling like -5 to -8C in strongest wind.

Freezing Level

Above the summits to start, may lower to just the high terrain during daylight, more certainly lowering into night.

Planning Outlook

Thursday will be windy with a swathe of rain affecting all areas at some point. A low pressure core is likely to affect the country on Friday, but detail is highly uncertain: there is a risk of rain and strong wind for central and southern areas, a general cooling trend. Snow returning to the Scottish Highlands, the snowfall level lowering into nighttime. A fast-moving ridge of high pressure leads into Saturday, then a return to west-southwesterly wind with bands of rain passing west to east through the weekend into the following week. Mixed conditions are indicated in the following week, with low and high pressure competing for dominance: freezing levels will vary, high Scottish terrain often at or below freezing, the level occasionally lifting to and above tops.
